# Custom startpage.
This is a custom website that I use as my browser homepage.

This is currently being rewriten to use flask.

This project is really stupid as it would make far more sense to use javascript instead of running with flask and also making it so more then one person can have bookmarks at a time on a server.

At the moment this websites contents has not been updated since 2019. as that was the last time i really used it.

At the moment I'm working towards making this far more customiable and have far more features.

At the present moment it only has a simple google searchbox and some links.

I want to make the links customiable and I want to add in otherthings like the weather and time.
